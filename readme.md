# ðŸŽ¹ midi-platformer 

**Midi-platformer** is a small game/toy made using Love2D. In it, it is possible to control a virtual keyboard using a MIDI controller, with the interface provided by [Lua-MIDI](https://github.com/PedroAlvesV/LuaMidi), creading notes in a piano roll that move upwards as platforms for a 2D player controller to jump around using AWSD or arrow keys to move.
